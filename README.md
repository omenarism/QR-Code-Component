# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I have learned how to use position to center an element(container). 
- Learned that there are much more unit that can be used for width and height(vw, vh, etc).
- That it is okay to use multiple headings/paragraphs(<h>, <p>) instead of cramping all sentences in one element and just realize don't get stuck on rules.

### Continued development

- I still have to practice positioning/sizing in css for the future.
- Have to learn if I have to put more div elements so it is easy to alter certain element involving sizing, positioning or animations and such.
- Applying JavaScript on website that I'm working on.
**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child] have helped me using :nth-child() for the headings and paragraphs used in this project.
- stackoverflow for the positioning, transform, left, right.
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width] with max-width I used in CSS.
- the unit 100vh/vh for width and height. Since the element I needed to center didn't go as I would hoped.
